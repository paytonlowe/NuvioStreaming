## Wanna run it? üöÄ

1.  You'll need Node.js, npm/yarn, and the Expo Go app (or native build tools like Android Studio/Xcode).
2.  `git clone https://github.com/nayifleo1/NuvioExpo.git`
3.  `cd NuvioExpo`
4.  `npm install` or `yarn install`
5.  `npx expo start` (Easiest way: Scan QR code with Expo Go app)
    *   Or `npx expo run:android` / `npx expo run:ios` for native builds.
